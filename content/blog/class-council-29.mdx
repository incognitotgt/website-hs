*statement and other stuff for me running for my school's class council*

# statement

I’m excited to be your Vice President for the class of 2029! I believe students should have a voice that makes a real impact, and I want a WT that’s inclusive, united, and safe. As the Vice President, I’ll work with the council, along with the school and even BCPS, for inclusive school lunches that cater to the dietary needs of everyone; more mental health services by pushing for a dedicated TTT class for mental and social health to help students in need, SEL training for all teachers; a cleaner school campus so that students feel safe—no student should have to deal with a dirty bathroom or feel unsafe in a unclean building; and more field trips so that students can have fun with their peers somewhere else and have somewhere to unwind. In terms of experience, I served as the Legislative Affairs Coordinator for BCSC/JC last year, where I talked and negotiated with lawmakers in Annapolis on bills that affected us. I also have experience in student leadership, having started and been the president of my middle school’s Muslim Student Association—planning events, growing membership, and more. As the Vice President for the class of ‘29, I’ll be advocating tirelessly for my peers, making sure your voice is heard.
