*statement and other stuff for me running for my school's class council*

# statement

I’m excited to be your Vice President for the class of 2029! I believe students should have a voice that creates real, tangible impact. As the Vice President, I’ll work with the council, along with the school and even BCPS, to implement inclusivity, safety, and change. This includes, __but is NOT limited to__, advocating for inclusive school lunches that cater to everyone, more ways for students to showcase their culture, more mental health services, such as a dedicated place for students struggling, a cleaner school campus (such as fixing the bathrooms), and a nicer one too! WT’s campus looks bland outside right now, but that can be changed :) Safety is another thing we’re pushing for—why are the doors always unlocked, and why are teachers allowed to get away with disgusting things? Finally, we want more student activities. This includes more field trips and spirit activities so that students can unwind from the stress of school with their peers. It’s not limited to that, however! I’m open-minded and am more than happy to listen to your concerns/ideas. In terms of experience, I’m currently a board member for WT MSA. I also served as the Legislative Affairs Coordinator for BCSC/JC last year, where I talked and negotiated with lawmakers in Annapolis on bills that affected us. I also founded my middle school’s MSA, where I planned events, grew membership, and learned what it takes to manage a student organization. As the Vice President for the class of ‘29, I’ll be advocating tirelessly for my peers, making sure __your__ voice is heard.
